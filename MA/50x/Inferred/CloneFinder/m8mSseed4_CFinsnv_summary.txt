total read count cutoff: 1
mutant read count cutoff: 1
clone frequency cutoff: 0.0001

hybrid sample genotypes were suggested: ['PSec2', 'M6']
decomposed clone genotypes are not good (create more backward/parallel mutations), so clones were not decomposed.
100.0% of SNV sites are not affected by backward/parallel mutations.
