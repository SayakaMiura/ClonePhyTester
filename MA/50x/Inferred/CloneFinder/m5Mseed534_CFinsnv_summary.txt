total read count cutoff: 1
mutant read count cutoff: 1
clone frequency cutoff: 0.0001

hybrid sample genotypes were suggested: ['M1', 'M3']
decomposed clone genotypes are not good (create more backward/parallel mutations), so clones were not decomposed.
90.9090909091% of SNV sites are not affected by backward/parallel mutations.
