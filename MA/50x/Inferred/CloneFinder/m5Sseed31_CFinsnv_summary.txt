hybrid sample genotypes were suggested: ['M4']
Hybrid sample genotype was decomposed
hybrid sample genotypes were suggested: ['M4']
decomposed clone genotypes are not good (create more backward/parallel mutations), so clones were not decomposed.
100.0% of SNV sites are not affected by backward/parallel mutations.
